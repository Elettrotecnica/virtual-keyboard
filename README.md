# A virtual keyboard as a PWA

This simple keyboard allows to type text without an actual keyboard
available and to copy-paste the text somewhere else.

Can be installed as a PWA

I have made this for personal use for a very specific use case. It is
mostly copy-pasted, but also partially vibe-coded.

## Acknowledgments

This keyboard is based on https://github.com/hodgef/simple-keyboard
and is mostly a copy paste of the iOS demo
